The safeguard control provides a mechanism to keep an eye on the system
while running an experiment to decide if the experiment ought to stop as soon
as possible or not.

For instance, let's say your system detects a dire condition that has nothing
to do with this experiment. It may decide it's time for the experiment to
terminate as it could create even more noise or problems.

To use this control, simply add the following to your global (or per
experiment) controls block:

```json
"controls": [
    {
        "name": "safeguard",
        "provider": {
            "type": "python",
            "module": "chaosaddons.controls.safeguards",
            "arguments": {
                "probes": [
                    {
                        "name": "safeguard_1",
                        "type": "probe",
                        "provider": {
                            "type": "python",
                            "module": "mymodule",
                            "func": "checkstuff"
                        },
                        "background": true,
                        "tolerance": true
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "safeguard_2",
                        "type": "probe",
                        "provider": {
                            "type": "python",
                            "module": "mymodule",
                            "func": "checkstuff"
                        },
                        "tolerance": true
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "safeguard_3",
                        "type": "probe",
                        "provider": {
                            "type": "python",
                            "module": "mymodule",
                            "func": "checkstuff"
                        },
                        "frequency": 2,
                        "tolerance": true
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
],
```

In this example, we declare three safeguard probes. The first one will run
once in the background as soon as possible. The second one will run once
before the experiment starts. The third one will run repeatedly every 2
seconds.

If either of them doesn't meet its tolerance, the entire execution will
terminate as soon as possible and leave the status of the experiment to
`interrupted`.

Probes that do not declare the `background` or `frequency` properties are meant
to run before the experiment really starts and will block until they are all
finished. This offers a mechanism for pre-checking the system's health.

When the properties are set, the probes run as soon as possible but do not
block the experiment from carrying on.

Bear in mind that your probes can also block the process from exiting. This
means that while the experiment has ended, your probe could be not returning
and therefore blocking the process. Make sure your probe do not make blocking
calls for too long.
